This project is basically about providing a web-based application that can facilitate all your financial transactions and make it possible for start-up businesses to know where exactly their revenues and expenses are going so far and get notified with their Net Profits' values every now and then. There is an overview for the project's current month progress. This shows whether you as a start-up business is on the right track or not.
